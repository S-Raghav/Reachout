# Reachout
an application for getting jobs done through collaboration

I created Reachout to provide a platform where people can voice their grievances by marking locations where they face problems,
specify the type of problem and once that is done people can view the problems as bubbles on the main screen

The code is currently a prototype and is in need of heavy refactoring for proper usage

All you need is a web server with PHP support to start working on this
